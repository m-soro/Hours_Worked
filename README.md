**Salary or Hourly?**

> Having been an hourly employee from the start of my working life up to June 2021, I decided to create an app to track my salaried hours. This is built entirely on google colab and stores data in my google drive.

**Libraries used**:
* pandas
* datetime
* pytz
* csv
* xcelwriter

**Features**:

* **Hours Analyses** - Average hours worked by week and day
* **Analyses Table** - Hours worked vs hour rate vs overtime rate
* **Back ups** - Auto saves into csv and excel file in google drive
* **Data Visualization** - Quickly see trends

**Functionalities**:

* log time or time out with just a click
* undo last log
* edit time in or time out
* number of records are returned after every log, to ensure accuracy
